## 1. About Me

Hello! I am **SUN HANFEI**, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and student currently enrolled in the WQE7001 Cyber Security course. My journey involves bridging the gap between software development and network security, with a strong focus on using machine learning to enhance active defense mechanisms.

* **Current Role:** Student 
* **Interests:** Network Security, Machine Learning in Security, Vulnerability Analysis.

## 2. Technical Skills

My technical toolkit includes a blend of security tools, programming, and data analysis frameworks:

* **Languages & Frameworks:** Python (Flask, Scapy, Pandas, Seaborn, joblib).
* **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Data Augmentation (SDV).
* **Network Security:** Nmap, ACLs, UFW, EIGRP configuration, MAC flooding mitigation.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Shodan API, NVD API, CVSS metrics analysis.

## 3. Certifications and Training

* **WQE7001 Cyber Security:** University of Malaya (In Progress).

## 4. Project Experience

### Project A: Active Defense Dashboard with ML

**Objective:** Developed a real-time dashboard to classify network traffic and log incidents using machine learning.

* **Tools:** Flask, Scapy, Machine Learning (Random Forest/XGBoost).
* **Methodology:** Captured real-time traffic using Scapy, processed features, and fed them into a trained ML model for classification.
* **Outcome:** Successfully created a visual interface that flags malicious traffic patterns and assists in immediate incident response.
### Project B: Vulnerability Analysis & Risk Assessment Tool

**Objective:** Automated the assessment of CVE risks by integrating public threat intelligence sources.

* **Tools:** Python, Shodan API, NVD API, Pandas, Seaborn.
* **Methodology:** Aggregated data from Shodan and NVD to correlate device exposures with known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
* **Outcome:** Delivered a tool that generates visual reports (using Seaborn) to prioritize patching based on CVSS scores and exploitability.

## 5. Learning Journey

Throughout the WQE7001 course and my personal projects, I have deepened my understanding of how offensive and defensive strategies intersect.

* **Progress:** I have moved from basic scripting to building complex security tools that leverage AI.
* **Challenges:** Initially, integrating real-time packet capture (Scapy) with a web framework (Flask) was challenging due to concurrency issues.
* **Future Goals:** I plan to improve my skills in reverse engineering and obtain the [Insert Certification Name, e.g., OSCP] certification.

## 6. Career Objective

To leverage my skills in Python automation and machine learning to secure enterprise networks as a **Cybersecurity Analyst** or **Security Engineer**.
